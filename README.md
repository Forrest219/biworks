# BIWorks

BIWorks is an open source package that includes useful tools for data cleaning, data integration and data analysis, etc.
Most of the needs comes from my daily works. I'd like to share them throgh the Internet. 

If you have any idea, please contact me: zhangxc219@163.com.

## 1. Why Python?

I had learned two programing languages when I was in University major in Mathmatics: C & Java. The only thing I can remember is how difficult it is to learn those languages. And they hurt my heart.

When my friend & teacher Lin ZhiXiong teched me how to use Python, I was shocked by how strightforward the python code is to solve the real problem. Even though I know nothing about python at that time, I still understood what he was doing.

> I believe if you can read the code, you can learn how to write it quickly. By contrast, if you can hardly read the code, it will be harder to learn how to write it correctly.

Compare to the C & Java, Python is the more easy to understand and write, far more! If you can read, you can learn(I'm not kidding!).

What's more, thanks to the open source projects, such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, Python is not only an powerfull programing language that worth to learn, but also an power tool for data science. If you are working with data related jobs (for example, business intellgence), I strongly suggest you to learn python. 

Trust me, the only thing you will regret is how late is it to learn python.
